For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the "Sliver of Infinity," reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier "snapped" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.

Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Then Kelsier reveals his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.

But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets. She will have to learn trust if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.

Brandon Sanderson, fantasy's newest master tale-spinner and author of the acclaimed debut Elantris, dares to turn a genre on its head by asking a simple question: What if the prophesied hero failed to defeat the Dark Lord?

PROLOGUE

Wayne knew about beds. Other kids in Tinweight Settlement had them. A bed sounded much better than a mat on the ground—especially one he had to share with his ma when the nights were cold, because they didn’t have any coal.

Plus there were monsters under beds.
Yeah, he’d heard stories of mistwraiths. They’d hide unner your bed and steal the faces of people you knew. Which made beds soft and squishy on top, with someone underneath you could talk to. Sounded like rustin’ heaven.

Other kids were scared of mistwraiths, but Wayne figured they just didn’t know how to negotiate properly. He could make friends with something what lived unner a bed. You just had to give it something it wanted, like someone else to eat.

Anyway, no bed for him. And no proper chairs. They had a table, built by Uncle Gregr. Back before he got crushed by a billion rocks in a landslide and mushed into a pulp what couldn’t hit people no more. Wayne kicked the table sometimes, in case Gregr’s spirit was watching and was fond of it. Rusts knew there was nothing else in this one-window home Uncle Gregr had cared about.

Best Wayne had was a stool, so he sat on that and played with his cards—dealing hands and hiding cards up his sleeve—as he waited. This was a nervous time of day. Every evening he feared she wouldn’t come home. Not because she didn’t love him. Ma was a burst of sweet spring flowers in a sewage pit of a world. But because one day Pa hadn’t come home. One day Uncle Gregr—Wayne kicked the table—hadn’t come home. So Ma . . .

Don’t think about it, Wayne thought, bungling his shuffle and spilling cards over the table and floor. And don’t look. Not until you see the light.

He could feel the mine out there; nobody wanted to live nexta it, so Wayne and his ma had to.

He thought of something else, on purpose. The pile of laundry by the wall that he’d finished washing earlier. That had been Ma’s old job what didn’t pay well enough. Now he did it while she pushed minecarts.

Wayne didn’t mind the work. Got to try on all the different clothes—whether they were from old gramps or young women—and pretend to be them. His ma had caught him a few times and grown angry. Her exasperation still baffled him. Why wouldn’t you try them on? That’s what clothes was for. It wasn’t nothing weird.

Besides, sometimes folks left stuff in their pockets. Like decks of cards.

He fumbled the shuffle again, and as he gathered the cards up he did not look out the window, even though he could feel the mine. That gaping artery, like the hole in someone’s neck, red from the inside and spurting out light like blood and fire. His ma had to go dig at the beast’s insides, searchin’ for metals, then escape its anger. You could only get lucky so many times.

Then he spotted it. Light. With relief, he glanced out the window and saw someone walking along the path, holding up a lantern to illuminate her way. Wayne scrambled to hide the cards under the mat, then lay on top, feigning sleep when the door opened. She’d have seen his light go out of course, but she appreciated the effort he put into pretending.

She settled on the stool, and Wayne cracked an eye. His ma wore trousers and a buttoned shirt, her hair up, her clothing and face smudged. She sat staring at the flame in the lantern, watching it flicker and dance, and her face seemed more hollow than it had been before. Like someone was taking a pickaxe to her cheeks.

That mine’s eatin’ her away, he thought. It hasn’t gobbled her up like it did Pa, but it’s gnawing on her.

Ma blinked, then fixated on something else. A card he’d left on the table. Aw, hell.

She picked it up, then looked right at him. He didn’t pretend to be asleep no more. She’d dump water on him.
“Wayne,” she said, “where did you get these cards?”
“Don’t remember.”
“Wayne . . .”
“Found ’em,” he said.

She held out her hand, and he reluctantly pulled the deck out and handed it over. She tucked the card she’d found into the box. Damn. She’d spend a day searching Tinweight for whoever had “lost” them. Well, he wouldn’t have her losing more sleep on account of him.

“Tark Vestingdow,” Wayne mumbled. “They was inna pocket of his overalls.”
“Thank you,” she said softly.
“Ma, I’ve gotta learn cards. That way I can earn a good livin’ and care for us.”
“A good livin’?” she asked. “With cards?”
“Don’t worry,” he said quickly. “I’ll cheat! Can’t make a livin’ if you don’t win, see.”

She sighed, rubbing her temples.
Wayne glanced at the cards in their stack. “Tark,” he said. “He’s Terris. Like Pa was.”
“Yes.”
“Terris people always do what they’re told. So what’s wrong with me?”
“Nothing’s wrong with you, love,” she said. “You just haven’t got a good parent to guide you.”

“Ma,” he said, scrambling off the mat to take her arm. “Don’t talk like that. You’re a great ma.”

She hugged him to her side, but he could feel her tension. “Wayne,” she asked, “did you take Demmy’s pocketknife?”

“He talked?” Wayne said. “Rust that rustin’ bastard!”
“Wayne! Don’t swear like that.”
“Rust that rusting bastard!” he said in a railworker’s accent instead.

DUNE MESSIAH
INTRODUCTION
BY BRIAN HERBERT

Dune Messiah is the most misunderstood of Frank Herbert's novels. The reasons for this are as fascinating and complex as the renowned author himself.

Just before this first sequel to Dune was published in 1969, it ran in installments in the science fiction magazine Galaxy. The serialized “Dune Messiah” was named “disappointment of the year” by the satirical magazine National Lampoon. The story had earlier been rejected by Analog editor John W. Campbell, who, like the Lampooners, loved the majestic, heroic aspects of Dune and hated the antithetical elements of the sequel. His readers wanted stories about heroes accomplishing great feats, he said, not stories of protagonists with “clay feet.”

The detractors did not understand that Dune Messiah was a bridging work, connecting Dune with an as-yet-uncompleted third book in the trilogy. To get there, the second novel in the series flipped over the carefully crafted hero myth of Paul Muad’Dib and revealed the dark side of the messiah phenomenon that had appeared to be so glorious in Dune. Many readers didn’t want that dose of reality; they couldn’t stand the demotion of their beloved, charismatic champion, especially after the author had already killed off two of their favorite characters in Dune, the loyal Atreides swordmaster Duncan Idaho* and the idealistic planetologist Liet-Kynes.

But they overlooked important clues that Frank Herbert had left along the way. In Dune, when Liet-Kynes lay dying in the desert, he remembered these words of his father, Pardot, spoken years before and relegated to the back reaches of memory: “No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero.” Near the end of the novel, in a foreshadowing epigraph, Princess Irulan described the victorious Muad’Dib in multifaceted and sometimes conflicting terms as “warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man.” And in an appendix to Dune, Frank Herbert wrote that the desert planet “was afflicted by a Hero.”

These sprinklings in Dune were markers pointing in the direction Frank Herbert had in mind, transforming a utopian civilization into a violent dystopia. In fact, the original working title for the second book in the series was Fool Saint, which he would change two more times before settling on Dune Messiah. But in the published novel, he wrote, concerning Muad’Dib:

He is the fool saint,
The golden stranger living forever
On the edge of reason.
Let your guard fall and he is there!

The author felt that heroic leaders often made mistakes . . . mistakes that were amplified by the number of followers who were held in thrall by charisma. As a political speechwriter in the 1950s, Dad had worked in Washington, D.C., and had seen the megalomania of leadership and the pitfalls of following magnetic, charming politicians. Planting yet another interesting seed in Dune, he wrote, “It is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness.” This was an important reference to Greek hubris. Very few readers realized that the story of Paul Atreides was not only a Greek tragedy on an individual and familial scale. There was yet another layer, even larger, in which Frank Herbert was warning that entire societies could be led to ruination by heroes. In Dune and Dune Messiah, he was cautioning against pride and overconfidence, that form of narcissism described in Greek tragedies that invariably led to the great fall.

Among the dangerous leaders of human history, my father sometimes mentioned General George S. Patton because of his charismatic qualities—but more often his example was President John F. Kennedy. Around Kennedy, a myth of kingship had formed, and of Camelot. The handsome young president’s followers did not question him and would have gone virtually anywhere he led them. This danger seems obvious to us now in the cases of such men as Adolf Hitler, whose powerful magnetism led his nation into ruination. It is less obvious, however, with men who are not deranged or evil in and of themselves—such as Kennedy, or the fictional Paul Muad’Dib, whose danger lay in the religious myth structure around him and what people did in his name.

Among my father’s most important messages were that governments lie to protect themselves and they make incredibly stupid decisions. Years after the publication of Dune, Richard M. Nixon provided ample proof. Dad said that Nixon did the American people an immense favor in his attempt to cover up the Watergate misdeeds. By amplifying example, albeit unwittingly, the thirty-seventh president of the United States taught people to question their leaders. In interviews and impassioned speeches on university campuses all across the country, Frank Herbert warned young people not to trust government, telling them that the American founding fathers had understood this and had attempted to establish safeguards in the Constitution.

In the transition from Dune to Dune Messiah, Dad accomplished something of a sleight of hand. In the sequel, while emphasizing the actions of the heroic Paul Muad’Dib, as he had done in Dune, the author was also orchestrating monumental background changes and dangers involving the machinations of the people surrounding that leader. Several people would vie for position to become closest to Paul; in the process they would secure for themselves as much power as possible, and some would misuse it, with dire consequences.

After the Dune series became wildly popular, many fans began to consider Frank Herbert in a light that he had not sought and which he did not appreciate. In one description of him, he was referred to as “a guru of science fiction.” Others depicted him in heroic terms. To counter this, in remarks that were consistent with his Paul Atreides characterization, Frank Herbert told interviewers that he did not want to be considered a hero, and he sometimes said to them, with disarming humility, “I’m nobody.”

Certainly my father was anything but that. In Dreamer of Dune, the biography I wrote about him, I described him as a legendary author. But in his life, he sought to avoid such a mantle. As if whispering in his own ear, Frank Herbert constantly reminded himself that he was mortal. If he had been a politician, he would have undoubtedly been an honorable one, perhaps even one of our greatest U.S. presidents. He might have attained that high office, or reached any number of other goals, had he decided to do so. But as a science fiction fan myself, I’m glad he took the course he did. Because he was prescient, his cautionary words will carry on through time.

### Pumpkin

"And that's where we're supposed to spend the summer?!" Jenna scrunched up her face and glared at Max, who was sleepily leaning against the rear left window of her parents' tiny family car.

"Mmm..." he hummed.

"You're asleep!" she accused.

Max blinked groggily. "Yeah, we've been driving for almost five hours. What did you expect me to do?"

"I don't know, maybe take an interest in where we're going? Try to figure it out?"

"Why? Would it change anything?" he mumbled, closing his eyes.

"I don't know, maybe because it's important? Maybe because we're spending six weeks there? Maybe because this place is so insignificant it doesn’t even show up on the map?!"

"It'll be fine..." Max muttered and drifted back to sleep.

"Ugh!" Jenna groaned and turned her gaze back to the window. It was her first time leaving the big city, heading to the Midwest of the United States. The scenery gradually shifted from tightly packed skyscrapers to suburban homes and finally to isolated farmhouses and endless fields of farmland. Jenna didn’t like it. She felt secure among the concrete jungles of the city, where everything was close by, noise was constant, and people were always around. She couldn’t imagine what she'd do with all the quiet once they arrived.

Despite her determination to stay awake and understand where they were heading, the long drive eventually wore her out, and she fell asleep.

She woke up to the car stopping abruptly, with dust swirling around them. They had arrived. The place looked desolate. A small, shriveled woman stood in the doorway of an old farmhouse. Above her hung a battered wooden sign with faded letters reading, "Aunt Rose’s Pumpkin Farm." On the right side of the sign, there was a small illustration of a pumpkin.

"Come on, kids, we're here," Jenna's mom said cheerfully, but Jenna knew it was fake enthusiasm.

They unbuckled their seatbelts and stepped out. Aunt Rose came to greet them, inviting Jenna’s parents inside for coffee since they were the first to arrive. Jenna and Max stayed outside, listening to the muffled voices coming from inside.

Jenna sat on the creaky wooden steps, resting her chin in her hands, while Max leaned on the broken railing. They surveyed the area. Like every farm Jenna had seen in movies, this one was completely isolated, surrounded only by vast pumpkin fields and clusters of trees in the distance. The house itself looked ancient and weathered, with rotting wood beams and deep scratches, as if a tornado had torn through it. Max mentioned the scratches might be from flying debris during a storm, and Jenna nodded in agreement.

About forty yards from the house stood a barn with doors swaying slightly in the breeze. They assumed it stored farm equipment. There were no animals around, and Jenna thought of Mr. Whiskers, her fat and lazy cat, realizing how much she'd miss him.

"What a waste of a summer. We could've been at a camp right now, lounging on a boat at some lake... but no. We're here, in the middle of nowhere, harvesting pumpkins like mules," Max sighed.

"Yeah, it's really strange. This whole place feels like it popped up out of nowhere. And what's with Aunt Rose? Whose aunt is she, anyway? It seems like no one else lives here," Jenna fumed. "And what are we even supposed to do here, cut off from civilization? Look—" she held up her phone. "Barely any signal, let alone internet. It's inhumane."

"Yeah, it's annoying, but there’s not much we can do. At least some people we know from school are coming."

Jenna raised an eyebrow. "What? Who else is supposed to come?"

"I know Andy is coming, and maybe Michael Boone and Shirley too."

"Really?" For a moment, her anger subsided, and she felt a little better. "That’s nice."

"Yeah..." Max replied indifferently.

"Who even put this ridiculous idea in our parents’ heads?" Jenna was back to fuming.

"You missed it, I think. It happened the week you were sick," he recalled.

"What happened?"

Max furrowed his brow, trying to remember. "There was some meeting with the parents, and this group of overly cheerful weirdos showed up handing out flyers about 'Summer at Aunt Rose’s Farm.' They emphasized it was like camp, but they’d pay us because it’s work—learning the secrets of pumpkin harvesting or something like that..."

"Oh, right. I remember when my parents told me about it. It sounded so random. Really weird."

"Yeah, and somehow they agreed to it pretty quickly," he said bitterly.

Jenna sighed. "Honestly, I don’t think they had a choice, Maxie. They can’t really afford to send us to some camp or anything. You know that. I’m just daydreaming about those things."

"That’s nonsense. We could’ve stayed home and worked there. We didn’t have to cross half the country for this."

In the distance, they heard music approaching. "Hey! A car’s coming."

They turned toward the driveway. Loud music blared as a black van screeched to a halt near the house, enveloped in a cloud of dust. The side door slammed open, and a dark-haired teenager jumped out, slamming it shut behind him.

Someone inside the van turned down the music. "Cody! Call me after you settle in!" a male voice shouted from the front seat. Cody didn’t even glance back. He just glared at Jenna and Max, slung a black bag over his shoulder, and went to sit in the shade on a rusty plow. The van drove off, its music fading quickly, leaving silence behind.

"I can’t believe it!" Jenna moved closer to Max and whispered. "That’s Cody Walker! There are rumors about him at school that stretch all the way to Canada!"
