# For a thousand years the ash fell and no flowers bloomed. For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the "Sliver of Infinity," reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier "snapped" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.
#
# Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Then Kelsier reveals his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.
#
# But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets. She will have to learn trust if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.

# DUNE MESSIAH
# INTRODUCTION
# BY BRIAN HERBERT
#
# Dune Messiah is the most misunderstood of Frank Herbert's novels. The reasons for this are as fascinating and complex as the renowned author himself.
#
# Just before this first sequel to Dune was published in 1969, it ran in installments in the science fiction magazine Galaxy. The serialized ‚ÄúDune Messiah‚Äù was named ‚Äúdisappointment of the year‚Äù by the satirical magazine National Lampoon. The story had earlier been rejected by Analog editor John W. Campbell, who, like the Lampooners, loved the majestic, heroic aspects of Dune and hated the antithetical elements of the sequel. His readers wanted stories about heroes accomplishing great feats, he said, not stories of protagonists with ‚Äúclay feet.‚Äù
#
# The detractors did not understand that Dune Messiah was a bridging work, connecting Dune with an as-yet-uncompleted third book in the trilogy. To get there, the second novel in the series flipped over the carefully crafted hero myth of Paul Muad‚ÄôDib and revealed the dark side of the messiah phenomenon that had appeared to be so glorious in Dune. Many readers didn‚Äôt want that dose of reality; they couldn‚Äôt stand the demotion of their beloved, charismatic champion, especially after the author had already killed off two of their favorite characters in Dune, the loyal Atreides swordmaster Duncan Idaho* and the idealistic planetologist Liet-Kynes.
#
# But they overlooked important clues that Frank Herbert had left along the way. In Dune, when Liet-Kynes lay dying in the desert, he remembered these words of his father, Pardot, spoken years before and relegated to the back reaches of memory: ‚ÄúNo more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero.‚Äù Near the end of the novel, in a foreshadowing epigraph, Princess Irulan described the victorious Muad‚ÄôDib in multifaceted and sometimes conflicting terms as ‚Äúwarrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man.‚Äù And in an appendix to Dune, Frank Herbert wrote that the desert planet ‚Äúwas afflicted by a Hero.‚Äù
#
# These sprinklings in Dune were markers pointing in the direction Frank Herbert had in mind, transforming a utopian civilization into a violent dystopia. In fact, the original working title for the second book in the series was Fool Saint, which he would change two more times before settling on Dune Messiah. But in the published novel, he wrote, concerning Muad‚ÄôDib:
#
# He is the fool saint,
# The golden stranger living forever
# On the edge of reason.
# Let your guard fall and he is there!
#
# The author felt that heroic leaders often made mistakes . . . mistakes that were amplified by the number of followers who were held in thrall by charisma. As a political speechwriter in the 1950s, Dad had worked in Washington, D.C., and had seen the megalomania of leadership and the pitfalls of following magnetic, charming politicians. Planting yet another interesting seed in Dune, he wrote, ‚ÄúIt is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness.‚Äù This was an important reference to Greek hubris. Very few readers realized that the story of Paul Atreides was not only a Greek tragedy on an individual and familial scale. There was yet another layer, even larger, in which Frank Herbert was warning that entire societies could be led to ruination by heroes. In Dune and Dune Messiah, he was cautioning against pride and overconfidence, that form of narcissism described in Greek tragedies that invariably led to the great fall.
#
# Among the dangerous leaders of human history, my father sometimes mentioned General George S. Patton because of his charismatic qualities‚Äîbut more often his example was President John F. Kennedy. Around Kennedy, a myth of kingship had formed, and of Camelot. The handsome young president‚Äôs followers did not question him and would have gone virtually anywhere he led them. This danger seems obvious to us now in the cases of such men as Adolf Hitler, whose powerful magnetism led his nation into ruination. It is less obvious, however, with men who are not deranged or evil in and of themselves‚Äîsuch as Kennedy, or the fictional Paul Muad‚ÄôDib, whose danger lay in the religious myth structure around him and what people did in his name.
#
# Among my father‚Äôs most important messages were that governments lie to protect themselves and they make incredibly stupid decisions. Years after the publication of Dune, Richard M. Nixon provided ample proof. Dad said that Nixon did the American people an immense favor in his attempt to cover up the Watergate misdeeds. By amplifying example, albeit unwittingly, the thirty-seventh president of the United States taught people to question their leaders. In interviews and impassioned speeches on university campuses all across the country, Frank Herbert warned young people not to trust government, telling them that the American founding fathers had understood this and had attempted to establish safeguards in the Constitution.
#
# In the transition from Dune to Dune Messiah, Dad accomplished something of a sleight of hand. In the sequel, while emphasizing the actions of the heroic Paul Muad‚ÄôDib, as he had done in Dune, the author was also orchestrating monumental background changes and dangers involving the machinations of the people surrounding that leader. Several people would vie for position to become closest to Paul; in the process they would secure for themselves as much power as possible, and some would misuse it, with dire consequences.
#
# After the Dune series became wildly popular, many fans began to consider Frank Herbert in a light that he had not sought and which he did not appreciate. In one description of him, he was referred to as ‚Äúa guru of science fiction.‚Äù Others depicted him in heroic terms. To counter this, in remarks that were consistent with his Paul Atreides characterization, Frank Herbert told interviewers that he did not want to be considered a hero, and he sometimes said to them, with disarming humility, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nobody.‚Äù
#
# Certainly my father was anything but that. In Dreamer of Dune, the biography I wrote about him, I described him as a legendary author. But in his life, he sought to avoid such a mantle. As if whispering in his own ear, Frank Herbert constantly reminded himself that he was mortal. If he had been a politician, he would have undoubtedly been an honorable one, perhaps even one of our greatest U.S. presidents. He might have attained that high office, or reached any number of other goals, had he decided to do so. But as a science fiction fan myself, I‚Äôm glad he took the course he did. Because he was prescient, his cautionary words will carry on through time.

PROLOGUE

Wayne knew about beds. Other kids in Tinweight Settlement had them. A bed sounded much better than a mat on the ground‚Äîespecially one he had to share with his ma when the nights were cold, because they didn‚Äôt have any coal.

Plus there were monsters under beds.
Yeah, he‚Äôd heard stories of mistwraiths. They‚Äôd hide unner your bed and steal the faces of people you knew. Which made beds soft and squishy on top, with someone underneath you could talk to. Sounded like rustin‚Äô heaven.

Other kids were scared of mistwraiths, but Wayne figured they just didn‚Äôt know how to negotiate properly. He could make friends with something what lived unner a bed. You just had to give it something it wanted, like someone else to eat.

Anyway, no bed for him. And no proper chairs. They had a table, built by Uncle Gregr. Back before he got crushed by a billion rocks in a landslide and mushed into a pulp what couldn‚Äôt hit people no more. Wayne kicked the table sometimes, in case Gregr‚Äôs spirit was watching and was fond of it. Rusts knew there was nothing else in this one-window home Uncle Gregr had cared about.

Best Wayne had was a stool, so he sat on that and played with his cards‚Äîdealing hands and hiding cards up his sleeve‚Äîas he waited. This was a nervous time of day. Every evening he feared she wouldn‚Äôt come home. Not because she didn‚Äôt love him. Ma was a burst of sweet spring flowers in a sewage pit of a world. But because one day Pa hadn‚Äôt come home. One day Uncle Gregr‚ÄîWayne kicked the table‚Äîhadn‚Äôt come home. So Ma . . .

Don‚Äôt think about it, Wayne thought, bungling his shuffle and spilling cards over the table and floor. And don‚Äôt look. Not until you see the light.

He could feel the mine out there; nobody wanted to live nexta it, so Wayne and his ma had to.

He thought of something else, on purpose. The pile of laundry by the wall that he‚Äôd finished washing earlier. That had been Ma‚Äôs old job what didn‚Äôt pay well enough. Now he did it while she pushed minecarts.

Wayne didn‚Äôt mind the work. Got to try on all the different clothes‚Äîwhether they were from old gramps or young women‚Äîand pretend to be them. His ma had caught him a few times and grown angry. Her exasperation still baffled him. Why wouldn‚Äôt you try them on? That‚Äôs what clothes was for. It wasn‚Äôt nothing weird.

Besides, sometimes folks left stuff in their pockets. Like decks of cards.

He fumbled the shuffle again, and as he gathered the cards up he did not look out the window, even though he could feel the mine. That gaping artery, like the hole in someone‚Äôs neck, red from the inside and spurting out light like blood and fire. His ma had to go dig at the beast‚Äôs insides, searchin‚Äô for metals, then escape its anger. You could only get lucky so many times.

Then he spotted it. Light. With relief, he glanced out the window and saw someone walking along the path, holding up a lantern to illuminate her way. Wayne scrambled to hide the cards under the mat, then lay on top, feigning sleep when the door opened. She‚Äôd have seen his light go out of course, but she appreciated the effort he put into pretending.

She settled on the stool, and Wayne cracked an eye. His ma wore trousers and a buttoned shirt, her hair up, her clothing and face smudged. She sat staring at the flame in the lantern, watching it flicker and dance, and her face seemed more hollow than it had been before. Like someone was taking a pickaxe to her cheeks.

That mine‚Äôs eatin‚Äô her away, he thought. It hasn‚Äôt gobbled her up like it did Pa, but it‚Äôs gnawing on her.

Ma blinked, then fixated on something else. A card he‚Äôd left on the table. Aw, hell.

She picked it up, then looked right at him. He didn‚Äôt pretend to be asleep no more. She‚Äôd dump water on him.
‚ÄúWayne,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwhere did you get these cards?‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remember.‚Äù
‚ÄúWayne . . .‚Äù
‚ÄúFound ‚Äôem,‚Äù he said.

She held out her hand, and he reluctantly pulled the deck out and handed it over. She tucked the card she‚Äôd found into the box. Damn. She‚Äôd spend a day searching Tinweight for whoever had ‚Äúlost‚Äù them. Well, he wouldn‚Äôt have her losing more sleep on account of him.

‚ÄúTark Vestingdow,‚Äù Wayne mumbled. ‚ÄúThey was inna pocket of his overalls.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said softly.
‚ÄúMa, I‚Äôve gotta learn cards. That way I can earn a good livin‚Äô and care for us.‚Äù
‚ÄúA good livin‚Äô?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúWith cards?‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he said quickly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll cheat! Can‚Äôt make a livin‚Äô if you don‚Äôt win, see.‚Äù

She sighed, rubbing her temples.
Wayne glanced at the cards in their stack. ‚ÄúTark,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Terris. Like Pa was.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
‚ÄúTerris people always do what they‚Äôre told. So what‚Äôs wrong with me?‚Äù
‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs wrong with you, love,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou just haven‚Äôt got a good parent to guide you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa,‚Äù he said, scrambling off the mat to take her arm. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk like that. You‚Äôre a great ma.‚Äù

She hugged him to her side, but he could feel her tension. ‚ÄúWayne,‚Äù she asked, ‚Äúdid you take Demmy‚Äôs pocketknife?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe talked?‚Äù Wayne said. ‚ÄúRust that rustin‚Äô bastard!‚Äù
‚ÄúWayne! Don‚Äôt swear like that.‚Äù
‚ÄúRust that rusting bastard!‚Äù he said in a railworker‚Äôs accent instead.
