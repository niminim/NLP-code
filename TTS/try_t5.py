In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission:
import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant,
Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nikeâ€™s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultra
of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable
symbols in the world today."""
